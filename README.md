# Basketball Players' Field Goal Percentage Tracker‚ú®

## üèÄ Background
Have you ever wondered the accuracy of each player's shooting during a game? Attempting to manually record it would be arduous, as you would need to discern which player took each shot, making the task highly laborious. Besides not everyone has a spare time to watch and analyze a full game match. For these reasons, we have created player's FG tracker using deep learning! :) 

## üß† Models
In this project, we utilized two models to achieve our aim. The first model is used to detect players, basketball, ring, shooting attempts, and successful shots made, whereas the second model focused on matching a person's identity across different locations in a video. In essence, we employed Object Detection and Person Re-Identification models to accomplish this project. For our object detection model, we used YOLO-NAS-L, which was trained using super-gradients library made by Deci-AI. As for Person Re-Identification, we opted for MobileNetV3 to ensure faster inference speed and a more compact model size.    

## ‚ìÇÔ∏è Faiss
Faiss is a library created by Meta that enables rapid searching of similarity betweeen multiple vector representations. This library was indispensable for our task as it allowed us to accurately determine and match a person's identity. We initially tested with L2 (Euclidean) distance to measure similarity and obtained good results. Nevertheless, upon further experiments, we discovered that utilizing cosine similarity yielded better outputs. Therefore, we have chosen to adopt cosine similarity as our definitive searching method.

## üñºÔ∏è Object Detection + Person Re-Identification Inference Diagram
This picture below presents an overview of our project's flow using a diagram. When an input frame is received, it undergoes object detection model, which identifies various entities such as players, basketball, ring, shot attempts and successful shots. Among these, we specifially extract instances of the 'player' class and feed them into the Re-ID model. The Re-ID model then produces embedded vectors representing each person's image. These vectors are added to Faiss, allowing us to obtain top 5 IDs corresponding to each embedded vector. Consequently, we leverage hard voting on these results to obtain the final ID with the highest confidence level.
